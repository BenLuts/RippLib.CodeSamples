## OutsideInTesting
This solution contains demo code to test your api from the outside in using Test Containers & Web Application Factory.
It is currently written in .NET 9 & assumes you have Docker installed.
It runs your api against both SQL Server & PostGreSQL
I also added a fake JWT Token, to illustrate how you can test a secured api
